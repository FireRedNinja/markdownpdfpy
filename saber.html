<h2>Lane Matchups Pt. 1: Trade vs Catch</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Categorise the matchup pre-level 6, so you know what to do in lane</p>
<ul>
<li>Poke</li>
<li>Catch</li>
<li>Trade
<ul>
<li>Usually have sustain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All-in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports are the most important part of laning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In trade vs catch</p>
<ul>
<li>you want to trade</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do we trade?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>trade with them whenever they want something</p>
<ul>
<li>most obvious, when they want a minion
<ul>
<li>best trades are on a ranged minion and cannon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when they are locking up for no reason</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep lane in the middle to give you good opportunity to trade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you trade when there is a reason to trade</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Priority</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>dont get hit by their &quot;catch&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your cs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use our category, trade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure you know what to do before something happens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a trade matchup and they dont, you want to trade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if they have a category that you dont have, dont do it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you do your category better than your opponent you will win</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lane Matchups Pt. 2: Catch vs Trade</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>try to avoid getting pressured on last hits and set up the wave to let the support to catch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we don't do anything until the support catches or I catch and my support follows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we are not starting anything unless we have matchup related ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to help support catch better, we want enemy to come to middle</p>
<ul>
<li>so freeze</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have flash, you will be ok from jungler gank if you don't trade while you are pushing</p>
<ul>
<li>after you push, don't trade and run from the jungler</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lane Matchups Pt. 3: All-in vs Trade</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>don't try to trade</p>
<ul>
<li>don't walk up if you don't have a reason to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>take the cs and back off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>don't try to do anything too crazy until you can all-in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can play around the jungle, in the sense that you can still flash out if the jungle shows up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are trying to go for an all in, make sure there isn't a gank incoming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>figure out ways to stop trading with you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>figure out ways to make an all</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to get more all-ins</h3>
<ul>
<li>if you clear the ward at tri-bush you could camp at lane bush for an all-in</li>
<li>clear ward at tri-bush and channel base for a second then camp the tri or lane bush</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mechanics: Counterplay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Counterplay - they have a way to kill you and you have a way to beat it</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Know how they could kill you?</li>
<li>How can I beat it?
<ul>
<li>Be specific on how your counterplay will run</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can execute, go for it</p>
<h2>Two Tips to Help You Win on ADC</h2>

<ul>
<li>When you hit tower you are vulnerable to engages</li>
</ul>
</li>
